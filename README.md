# Algorithms
A repo containing some of the cool algorithms I came across. Some of these are maintained as .hpp files and the interface can be used without knowing the internal details.
- graphs.hpp contains standard graph algorithms with the graph class based on adjacecny list representation
- number_theory.hpp contains algortihms concerning primaliry, factorisation, gcd, exponenentiation in a Field etc.
